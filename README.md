# Express + Lambda Serverless + DynamoDB

## DynamoDB connection

### configuration
- You need **aws-sdk** package to access you DynamoDB in AWS
- And you need **access-key-id** and **secret-access-key** to login aws
- here is the **.env** file you need to add. and **region**  is which your DynamoDB is in.

```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION = us-east-1
```

### Create and Update Tables

I use cloudformation to create all the resources. So this project assume all the table are created. (but what if I want to add a new table later)

## Upload to Lambda Function

## Express

## CloudFormation
